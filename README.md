# SMS Spam Classification Project

## Overview

This project focuses on building a machine learning model for classifying SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham). The primary objective is to create an accurate model capable of distinguishing between legitimate and unwanted messages.

## Introduction

Spam messages are a persistent challenge in communication systems. This project utilizes machine learning techniques to automatically categorize SMS messages as either spam or ham. The model is trained on a labeled dataset, enabling it to identify and filter out unwanted messages.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project [insert dataset source and description]. It contains labeled examples of SMS messages, with each message tagged as either spam or ham.
